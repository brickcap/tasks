When it comes to discussing legal topics one of the most difficult aspects is to
give a formal definition of the topic being discussed. One would want a definition
to cover as much detail about the subject as possible and yet it must be short and to the point.
Therefore with this guide we start with a very simple definition of contracts. Then we examine this
definition in the light of things that we learn as we progress through it with a special emphasis
on contracts formed between landlord and the tenant. 

<h3 id="what_is_a_contract">What is a contract?</h3>
 
"A contract is an agreement enforceable by law". This definition is quite simple and gives us
two points of discussion right at the start. 

*The agreement*

An agreement starts with an offer.
An offer to do something or to abstain from doing something. The person making such an offer
is said to be the *promisor* and the person to whom such an offer is being made is called the *promisee*.
An offer is therefore a proposal from a promisor to a promisee to do or to refrain from doing some act.

Now when the promisee accepts such a proposal then a promise is formed. Once a promise has
been made there is a consideration or a regard for that promise.

For example: If you are a landlord
and a tenant makes a promise to pay you $5 each month in exchange for living in your property and you accept that promise.
Then the act of paying $5 by the tenant is the consideration for his/her promise. And the act of letting the tenant
live peacefully in your property is the consideration for your promise.

Coming back to the discussion on agreements, every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration
for each other is an agreement. The promises may have classifications like say a reciprocal promise where one party will
fulfill a part of promise when the other party fulfills a part of theirs. The example of landlord and the tenant that
we discussed above is a reciprocal promise. The landlord will let the tenant live in his house as long as the tenant
pays rent to him. Every month both the landlord and the tenant fulfill a part of their consideration to each other.


*The communication*

The offer and the acceptance of the offer must be communicated. But the knowledge of the terms of the offer is essential for the acceptance. For example consider an advertisement by a landlord of his property:-

> To let a two bedroom set in sec 14. For more details contact:0000000000

A tenant can not claim an acceptance of the offer unless he first calls the landlord of the number given and gains information about the details of the offer. After knowing the details of the property to be rented the tenant may make an offer to the landlord which he may accept or reject. Similarly when you go to a grocery store to buy vegetables the items on display are not an offer to sell rather you have to make an offer to buy them to a shopkeeper. An offer may be communicated to the whole world. But once more the knowledge of the offer is necessary if you are to accept it.


Similarly the acceptance of the offer must be communicated before the agreement is formed. Now it is important to note that the acceptance must be communicated to the tight person. Taking the example above if A has advertised his property and you call him asking for details about the same and then send the communication of acceptance to say Sir James Paul McCartney (?) then the acceptance is invalid. You must communicate the acceptance of the offer to the landlord for it to be valid.

There may be a mode of communication. The landlord may accept ony the proposals that are sent to him on his email. In these cases it is necessary to follow the mode that is set by the other party.

The communication of the acceptance is complete when it comes into the knowledge of the proposer.
The communication of the proposal is complete when it comes into the knowledge
of the person who has the power to accept it.
The proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of it's acceptance is complete.
The acceptance may be revoked at any time the communication of the acceptance is complete,against the acceptor. 

Let's take the example of the advertisement above and apply the communication scenarios that we discussed.
