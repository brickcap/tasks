There is no legal definition of the phrase "Fair rent". It is only a methodology which is prescribed by the rent control act, according to which a "Rent Controller" can fix a rent which is fair to the landlord and the tenant.

The *determination* of the fair rent is based upon certain principles:-

1. The application for the determination of fair rent maybe made by either the tenant or the landlord of the building. On the application the "Rent Controller" may fix the fair rent after holding an inquiry.

2. In determination of the fair rent the rent prevailing in the locality at the time of the application is taken into account.

3. The rate of increase in rent is also fixed upon by the controller. There is an upper limit on the percentage at which the rent maybe increased (25% in India)

4. The controller may also fix the fair rent based on the compromise between the parties of the proceedings. Such a rent, if fixed, is binding only on the parties and their heirs. That is it will have no bearing on determination of future fair rents.

**Some comments**

The basic method for determining the fair rent and the core principle behind it is quite straightforward. A landlord or a tenant may apply for the determination of the fair rent. The rent controller takes into account the existing rent in the locality, decides upon the rate of increase in rent and fixes the rent.  But nonetheless it would be good if we could study a few judgments on the matter. I am referencing The Haryana Urban(Control of rent and eviction) Act. The laws may differ in your country but the principles won't.

*Arrears of rent*

1. Landlord filed an ejectment petition on the ground of non payment of rent- The tenant paid the rent at Rs 300/month- An application was filed by the tenant to fix a fair rent-The fair rent was fixed at Rs 200/month-Tenant can not claim any refunds on the excess rent already paid.

2. Tenant failed to deposit provisional rent assessed by rent controller- Eviction order passed against the tenant- The fair rent was subsequently revised on appeal-The eviction can not be reversed.

*Determination of fair rent*

1. There must be a bonafide need for the determination of fair rent. Mere filing of petition is not enough. 

*Fair rent*

1. Agreement of the lease period between parties expired on 31.12.1969- no subsisting agreement between parties- the application for determination of fair rent was filed on 20.12.1980-the approach of lower courts in determining the rent based on agreement which was valid up to 1969 is wrong.

2. Fair rent is to be determined based on the existing agreement between the parties- In the absence of agreement the rent prevailing in the locality is to be used as a reference.[Also note the point above. The agreement must be recent.]

3. Rate of rent is agreed upon by the parties- Either party can still move to the controller for determination of the fair rent.

4. Tenant is not liable to pay arrears of rent exceeding the fair rent in retrospective effect for a period covering more than 3 years. [It simply means that if the fair rent fixed is greater than the one which tenant was already paying then the tenant would not be required to pay the additional cost for a period of more than 3 years. Retrospective effect is limited to 3 years]

*Mesne profits*

Tenancy is terminated with the passing of decree of eviction and with effect from the said date the tenant is an unauthorized occupant-he is liable to pay compensation for use and occupation of premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if tenant hat vacated the premises. 

*Rate of rent*

Entries in house tax register are not conclusive about rate of rent.

**Revision of fair rent**

If a fair rent has been fixed, no further increase or decrease in such fair rent shall be permissible for a period of 5 years. [This provision seems to me quite specific. Check the laws in your country the period may differ]

An increase may be allowed in cases where any addition improvement or alteration has been carried out at the expense of the landlord at the request of the tenant.

A decrease maybe allowed in cases where there is a decrease or diminution in the accommodation or amenities provided.


**Claims in excess of fair rent**

1. The landlord shall not claim or receive any premium or sum in addition to the fair rent or any other rent in excess of the fair rent, but the landlord may stipulate for and receive in advance rent for one month.

2. Any agreement for the payment of any sum in addition to the fair rent is null and void. 

*Comments*

Let us discuss a few cases that can help us understand this section further.

*Applicability*

1. This section only applies to cases where a fair rent has already been fixed not to the ones where fair rent has not been fixed.

*Enhancement of rent*

1. The enhancement of rent by an agreement between the landlord and the tenant is valid-- but where a fair rent has been determined the rent can not be enhanced by agreement.

2. Where the landlord and the tenant agreed to enhanced rent from 250 to 400 P.M. by mutual agreement it was held that the agreement is not violative of the section [Also note the point above. The gist is enhancement of rent by agreement is valid as long as a fair rent has not been determined]


**Increase of rent on account of payment rates of local authorities**

1. The landlord is entitled to increase the rent of the building or the rented land after the commencement of tenancy if a fresh rate, cess or tax is levied in respect of the building or rented land by any local authority, or there is increase in the amount or such a rate, cess or tax being levied. The increase in rent shall not exceed the amount of any such rate, cess or tax. Further such increase in rent shall be payable by the tenant from the date of dispatch of written notice of demand sent by the landlord.


**Comments**


The idea is that a landlord may increase the rent if there is either a new tax on the property or the amount of existing taxes on the property are increased. The tenant will pay the increased rent only after a written notice is sent by the landlord this idea is supported by the following case:- 

There is no automatic liability of the tenant to pay. The increase in rent can be either by mutual agreement or by a written notice of increase. [Hardip Singh V/S Dr Kewal Krishan 1986(2) Rent LR 196(P&H)]

Hopefully this discussion on fair rent has given you some ideas on how to fix rent for your own property that is fair both for you and your tenant. To recap a fair rent is decided based on the prevailing rent in the locality subject to a fixed increase. Any agreement between the landlord and tenant influences the decision to determine fair rent. In case of an agreement only the rate of increase can be contested upon. Landlord can not claim anything in excess of fair rent.

Carefully determining a fair rent for your property can help you avoid the disputes that may arise with your tenant.
