There is no legal definition of the phrase "Fair rent". It is only a methodology which is prescribed by the rent control act, accodrding to which a "Rent Controller" can fix a rent which is fair to the landlord and the tenant.

The *determination* of the fair rent is based upon certain principles:-

1. The application for the determination of fair rent maybe made by either the tenant or the landlord of the building. On the application the "Rent Controller" may fix the fair rent after holding an inquiry.

2. In determination of the fair rent the rent prevailing in the locality at the time of the application is taken into accout.

3. The rate of increase in rent is also fixed upon by the controller. There is an upper limit on the percentage at which the rent maybe increased (25% in India)

4. The controller may also fix the fair rent based on the compromise between the parties of the proceedings. Such a rent, if fixed, is binding only on the parties and thier heirs. That is it will have no bearing on determination of future fair rents.

**Some comments**

The basic method for determining the fair rent and the core principle behind it is quite straightforward. A landlord or a tenant may apply for the determination of the fair rent. The rent controller takes into account the existing rent in the sai locality, decides upon the rate of increase in rent and fixes the rent.  But nonetheless it would be good if we could study a few judgements on the matter. I am referencing The Haryana Urban(Control of rent and eviction) Act. The laws may differ in your country but the principles won't.

*Arrears of rent*

1. Landlord filed an ejectment petition on the ground of non payment of rent- The tenant paid the rent at Rs 300/month- An application was filed by the tenant to fix a fair rent-The fair rent was fixed at Rs 200/month-Tenant can not claim any refunds on the excess rent already paid.

2. Tenant failed to deposit provisional rent assesed by rent controller- Eviction order passed against the tenant- The fair rent was subsequently revised on appeal-The eviction can not be reversed.

*Determination of fair rent*

1. There must be a bonafide need for the determination of fair rent. Mere filing of petition is not enough. 

*Fair rent*

1. Agreement of the lease period between parties expired on 31.12.1969- no subsisting agreement between parties- the application for determination of fair rent was filed on 20.12.1980-the approach of lower courts in determining the rent based on agreement which was valid upto 1969 is wrong.

2. Fair rent is to be determined based on the existing agreement between the parties- In the absence of agreement the rent prevailing in the locality is to be used as a reference.[Also note the point above. The agreement must be recent.]

3. Rate of rent is agreed upon by the parties- Either party can still move to the controller for determination of the fair rent.

4. Tenant is not liable to pay arrears of rent exceeding the fair rent in restrospective effect for a period covering more than 3 years. [It simply means that if the fair rent fixed is greater than the one which tenant was already paying then the tenant would not be required to pay the additional cost for a period of more than 3 years. Retrospective effect is limited to 3 years]

*Mesne profits*

Tenancy is terminated with the passing of decree of eviction and with effect from the said date the tenant is an unauthorized occupant-he is liable to pay compensation for use and occupation of premises at the same rate at which the landlord would have been able to let out the premises and earn rent if tenant hat vacated the premises. 

*Rate of rent*

Entries in house tax register are not conclusive about rate of rent.

**Revision of fair rent**

If a fair rent has been fixed, no further increase or decrease in such fair rent shall be permissable for a period of 5 years. [This provision seems to me quite specific. Check the laws in your country the period may differ]

An increase may be allowed in cases where any addition improvement or alteration has been carried out at the expense of the landlord at the request of the tenant.

A decrease maybe allowed in cases where there is a decrease or dimunition in the accomodation or amenities provided.


**Claims in excess of fair rent**

1. The landlord shall not claim or recieve any premium or sum in addition to the fair rent or eany other rent in excess of the fair rent, but the landlord may stipulate for and recieve in advance rent for one month.

2. Any agreement for the payment of any sum in addition to the fair rent is null and void.
