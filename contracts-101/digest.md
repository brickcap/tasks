When it comes to discussing legal topics one of the most difficult aspects is to
give a formal definition of the topic being discussed. One would want a definition
to cover as much detail about the subject as possible and yet it must be short and to the point.
Therefore with this guide we start with a very simple definition of contracts. Then we examine this
definition in the light of things that we learn as we progress through it with a special emphasis
on contracts formed between landlord and the tenant. 

<h3 id="what_is_a_contract">What is a contract?</h3>
 
"A contract is an agreement enforceable by law". This definition is quite simple and gives us
two points of discussion right at the start. 

*The agreement*

An agreement starts with an offer.
An offer to do something or to abstain from doing something. The person making such an offer
is said to be the *promisor* and the person to whom such an offer is being made is called the *promisee*.
An offer is therefore a proposal from a promisor to a promisee to do or to refrain from doing some act.

Now when the promisee accepts such a proposal then a promise is formed. Once a promise has
been made there is a consideration or a regard for that promise.

For example: If you are a landlord
and a tenant makes a promise to pay you $5 each month in exchange for living in your property and you accept that promise.
Then the act of paying $5 by the tenant is the consideration for his/her promise. And the act of letting the tenant
live peacefully in your property is the consideration for your promise.

Coming back to the discussion on agreements, every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration
for each other is an agreement. The promises may have classifications like say a reciprocal promise where one party will
fulfill a part of promise when the other party fulfills a part of theirs. The example of landlord and the tenant that
we discussed above is a reciprocal promise. The landlord will let the tenant live in his house as long as the tenant
pays rent to him. Every month both the landlord and the tenant fulfil a part of their consideration to each other.


*The communication*

The offer and the acceptance of the offer must be communicated. An offer may be communicated to the whole world. But the knowledge of the terms of the offer is essential for the acceptance. For example
