There is no legal definition of the phrase "Fair rent". It is only a methodology which is prescribed by the rent control act, accodrding to which a "Rent Controller" can fix a rent which is fair to the landlord and the tenant.

The *determination* of the fair rent is based upon certain principles:-

1. The application for the determination of fair rent maybe made by either the tenant or the landlord of the building. On the application the "Rent Controller" may fix the fair rent after holding an inquiry.

2. In determination of the fair rent the rent prevailing in the locality at the time of the application is taken into accout.

3. The rate of increase in rent is also fixed upon by the controller. There is an upper limit on the percentage at which the rent maybe increased (25% in India)

4. The controller may also fix the fair rent based on the compromise between the parties of the proceedings. Such a rent, if fixed, is binding only on the parties and thier heirs. That is it will have no bearing on determination of future fair rents.

**Some comments**

The basic method for determining the fair rent and the core principle behind it is quite straightforward. A landlord or a tenant may apply for the determination of the fair rent. The rent controller takes into account the existing rent in the sai locality, decides upon the rate of increase in rent and fixes the rent.  But nonetheless it would be good if we could study a few judgements on the matter. I am referencing The Haryana Urban(Control of rent and eviction) Act. The laws may differ in your country but the principles won't.

*Arrears of rent*

1. Landlord filed an ejectment petition on the ground of non payment of rent- The tenant paid the rent at Rs 300/month- An application was filed by the tenant to fix a fair rent-The fair rent was fixed at Rs 200/month-Tenant can not claim any refunds on the excess rent already paid.

2. Tenant failed to deposit provisional rent assesed by rent controller- Eviction order passed against the tenant- The fair rent was subsequently revised on appeal-The eviction can not be reversed.

*Determination of fair rent*

1. There must be a bonafide need for the determination of fair rent. Mere filing of petition is not enough.
